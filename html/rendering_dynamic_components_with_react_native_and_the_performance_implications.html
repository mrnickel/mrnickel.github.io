            <p><p>I am currently working on a project that needs to be very flexible and very dynamic. Different builds require slightly different UI. Thankfully
the same actions and business logic apply. My concern with this requirement was for upstream git merges. I wanted to ensure, as much as possible
that any updates wouldn&rsquo;t overwrite the custom UI.</p>

<p>In an effort to accomplish this task, I wanted to ensure that the UI was void of as much logic as possible. Because my React Native app runs on Redux I could leverage the container / dumb component design pattern to accomplish that task.</p>

<p>i.e. The container would <code>connect</code> all the appropriate props and dispatch actions, then <code>render</code> the appropriate component for the build.</p>

<p>First I wanted to verify that it was possible to import a component outside of the standard <code>import component from ...</code> syntax with the
<code>require</code> syntax, so that I could then verify that my desired pattern was even a possibility.</p>

<pre><code>render() {
  const listItemRowComponent = require('src/components/ListItemRowComponent1.tsx')
  return (&lt;listItemRowComponent prop1={'value1'} prop2={'value2} /&gt;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I refreshed my screen, and success! It worked!</p>

<p>Whenever implementing a new pattern I always want to try to measure the performance implications. So the question I wanted to answer was what are the performance
implications of requiring this component every time instead of simply importing it at the top of my class component.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do was to establish a baseline. How many milliseconds on average would it take to render my component when
doing a standard <code>import</code>?</p>

<p>So I fired up Google Chrome&rsquo;s peformance tool, started the recording, navigated to the screen, waited for the load and scrolled down a bit.
I then investigated the results.</p>

<p><img src="/images/base_line.png" alt="Baseline" title="Baseline" /></p>

<p>At a glance it looks as though the average rendering time is about 7ish ms. Fantastic! Under that desired 16ms we aim for.</p>

<p>I wonder what the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance#what-you-need-to-know-about-frames">React Native Perf Monitor</a> showed as well with regards to RAM usage and UI vs JS frames per second.</p>

<p>Before loading the list: 137ish MB, with 60 / 60 FPS.</p>

<p>Navigate to the List, load the 500 rows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ram goes up to: 158ish MB</li>
<li>with scrolling I see the UI thread go down to 58, but the JS stays consistent at 60. Great!</li>
</ul>

<p>I then implemented the above <code>render()</code> function to see what, if any, performance implications</p>

<p>Assumption: I won&rsquo;t see any dramatic differences.</p>

<p><img src="/images/require_all_the_time.png" alt="Require All The Time" title="Require all the time" /></p>

<p>There was a slight increase with this new method, but not dramatically so. I would say that it&rsquo;s in the area of acceptability.</p>

<p>One thing that I did notice however was that the Perf Monitor showed that the RAM usage went from about 158ish MB to 172ish MB. Not substantial, but not insigificant either.</p>

<p>Now I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obviously just requiring from a static string is no more flexible than doing an <code>import</code> from the top of the file. Can I use a variable?</li>
<li>Can I get that memory usage back down?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answer to the first question seems pretty obvious at first blush. Simply add a configuration property and reference it.</p>

<pre><code>// config.ts
export default {
  listItemRowComponent: 'src/components/ListItemRowComponent1.tsx'
}

// component.ts
render() {
  const listItemRowComponent = require(config.listItemRowComponent)
  return (&lt;listItemRowComponent prop1={'value1'} prop2={'value2'} /&gt;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out RN isn&rsquo;t a big fan of this approach, and I got the Red Screen of Death.</p>

<p>Okay&hellip; I definitely wanted to be able to define which component to use in my config file&hellip; what to do?</p>

<p>At this point I did what all developers do in this situation. I went to Google, which then pointed me to this wonderful <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33907218/react-native-use-variable-for-image-file">StackOverflow</a> post.</p>

<p>Of course! Just <code>require</code> it directly into my config value:</p>

<pre><code class="language-config.ts">export default {
  listItemRowComponent: require('src/components/ListItemRowComponent1.tsx').default
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then simply render the <code>config.listItemRowComponent</code> as such:</p>

<pre><code class="language-component.ts">render() {
  return (&lt;config.listItemRowComponent prop1={'value1'} prop2={'value2'} /&gt;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And it works! Awesome. This makes me happy. It&rsquo;s configurable, extendable and manageable. Great &lsquo;ables&rsquo; all around. And it&rsquo;s performant.</p>

<p>Taking a quick view of the performance snapshop I&rsquo;m seeing render times of roughly 9ms for the component when referenced as such.</p>

<p><img src="/images/require_config.png" alt="Require in config" title="Require in config" /></p>

<p>Perf Monitor is also reporting that my RAM usage is comparable to the standard <code>import component from ...</code> syntax. Fantastic!</p>

<p>One big downside to this pattern is that you lose the ability to quickly navigate to a components implementation within VS code, directly linking between
props and implementations, and you also lose the ability to refactor property types. Linters aren&rsquo;t going to catch any issues with the props either.
This could be a big issue if you lean on such tools heavily. I know that I rely heavily on the refactor abilities (naming things is hard!).</p>

<p>Note that perf monitor, and the Google Chrome Performance recording isn&rsquo;t exact. The app was tested while in DEV mode, which means that the performance
will be worse than in prodiction, however my thoughts are that if I can get the app running well without any React optimizations, when those are in place
the app will run even smoother.</p>
