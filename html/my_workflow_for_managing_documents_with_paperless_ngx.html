      <main class="e-content">
        <p>Managing a pile of documents can be a real headache, can’t it? I used to have all these papers stuffed into folders, always mixing things up. Was my business tax return in the “Tax Returns” folder or jammed in the “Business” one? And good luck finding anything in that mess!</p>

<h2>Enter the Digital Hero: Paperless</h2>

<p>Then, I decided enough was enough and started scanning all these documents to keep them in <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/">Paperless</a>. It was cool, but when I upgraded to Paperless-NGX, things got a whole lot cooler. Why? One word: <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/advanced_usage/#archive-serial-number-assignment">ASN (archive serial number) labels</a>. Sounds fancy, right? It basically means I slap a number on my paper documents, scan them, and bam – I can search for them in Paperless-NGX, then find it physically based on the number.</p>

<h2>The Magic of ASN Labels</h2>

<p>So, I stumbled upon this nifty tool by <a href="https://tobiasmaier.info/asn-qr-code-label-generator/">Tobias L. Maier</a> that lets me print out these ASN labels right at home. But oh boy, did I go through a ton of label sheets trying to get the printer settings right. Eventually, I found just the right printer settings so I wouldn’t waste more labels. It was a game-changer. (I have a fork of the tool with my notes <a href="https://ryannickel.com/asn-qr-code-label-generator/">here</a>)</p>

<h2>My New Workflow</h2>

<p>Now, here’s how I roll with my documents:</p>

<ol>
<li>Slap a Label: Every new document gets the next number in line. No guessing games.</li>
<li>Scan and Upload: I scan the doc, upload it to Paperless-NGX, and it’s in the system.</li>
<li>Physical Filing: Then, the paper version just goes on top of my physical pile. Easy to find with its number if I ever need it again.</li>
</ol>

<p>This setup has made my life a whole lot easier. No more digging through folders or wondering where I put that one bill. It’s all there, a search away in Paperless-NGX.</p>

<h2>Wrapping It Up: Living the Organized Life</h2>

<p>Switching from a chaotic pile of folders to a neat, numbered system with Paperless-NGX felt like a huge win. If you’re tired of playing hide and seek with your documents, give this method a shot. It’s pretty laid back once you get the hang of it, and you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it. Plus, you get to feel a bit like a librarian with your very own indexing system. Who doesn’t love that?</p>
