            <p><p>In a previous post playing with <a href="./on_adding_github_actions_to_my_staticsitegenerator.html">GitHub Actions</a> I thought it might be interseting to figure out how to distribute the binary via Homebrew.</p>

<p>While reading through the <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae">Acceptable Formulae</a> documentation, my dreams of being accepted into the Homebrew-core packages were dashed. (end sarcasm)</p>

<p>The primary rule that would be broken by this software are:</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>Niche (or self-submitted) stuff</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Namely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>be maintained (i.e. the last release wasnâ€™t ages ago, it works without patching on all Homebrew-supported OS versions and has no outstanding, unpatched security vulnerabilities)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The software <em>has</em> had an update in the past few weeks (at time of this writing), however previous to that was 4 years ago. Not exactly actively maintained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>be known</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody knows this software exists except for myself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>be used</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, I&rsquo;m the only user of it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have a homepage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&hellip; not yet, however perhaps a quick github self hosted page that&rsquo;s essentially the readme file.</p>

<p>The next question to answer is how can I self host this formula? Seeing as I highly doubt Homebrew would accept my PR (and for good reason. Please continue your processes).</p>

<p>In Homebrew parlance, what I want to create is a <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Taps">tap</a>. By default this relies on GitHub, which is perfect for this series of events.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to partially re-hash the official Homebrew documentation here for my own convenience:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a github repo <strong>/mrnickel/homebrew-mrnickel</strong>
This is the convention that Homebrew uses in order to tap properly.</li>
<li>Create the <strong>Go</strong> formula using:
 <code>brew create https://github.com/mrnickel/StaticSiteGenerator/archive/refs/tags/{RELEASE_VERSION_HERE}.tar.gz --go</code>
This will create a formula definition file that will be committed to the <strong>mrnickel/homebrew-mrnickel</strong> repo.</li>
<li>Edit the information as appropriate in the definition. Setting the <strong>desc, homepage, url</strong></li>
<li>Copy the file from <code>$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula</code> directory,  to the <strong>homebrew-mrnickel</strong> git directory.</li>
<li>Commit and push to the <strong>mrnickel/homebrew-mrnickel</strong> repository</li>
<li>Run <code>brew tap mrnickel/mrnickel</code></li>
<li>Run <code>brew install StaticSiteGenerator</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After some trial and error I came up with a suitable <a href="https://github.com/mrnickel/homebrew-mrnickel/blob/main/staticsitegenerator.rb">homebrew formula</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used Homebrew for many many years now. I&rsquo;ve never fully understood how it works, just that it works. It was interesting to dive into it a bit deeper. They&rsquo;ve done an excellent job with their documentation, and it&rsquo;s a well thought out package manager. I suppose that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essentially the default package manager for MacOS.</p>

<p>I spent far too much time googling for ways to create the formula file, and I should have instead have just relied on the <code>brew help</code> and <code>brew create help</code> documentation as it&rsquo;s well represented. If only more software took as much pride in their docs as Homebrew does.</p>

<p>One thing I wish they would add would be a way to specify the path of the generated .rb file.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve set up this homebrew tap, I can add this to some machine provisioning scripts I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write. Perhaps an article for another day. That along with some dotfiles that I should persist.</p>
