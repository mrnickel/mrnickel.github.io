In an effort to become more proficient with Swift and autolayout, I've decided that I'm going to start some UI experiments. This section will be about re-creating

![Aaron Miller's Music Player](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/5924/screenshots/2317091/009_drib_1x.png "Player UI")

This player UI was designed by [Aaron Miller](https://dribbble.com/aaronmiller) over at [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com)

## A few rules:

1. Written in swift
2. Pure code (no xib's)
3. Create as many of the "images" using fonts / code. i.e. limit the number of .png's. The only image that I *think* I have to implement is the album artwork. _fingers crossed_

I also want to see if I can get a few basic animations to work with this. The obvious being the timer bar and times to update dynamically. I'd also like to get the control to work by being dismissable. By that I mean you can swipe down on the control and it will transform into a minimized state and hang out at the bottom of the screen.
