As CTO and co-founder of [Volu.me](http://Volu.me) for the past 5 years, I have had the chance to gather a lot of experience. The nature of a startup is that you get the opportunity to wear many hats. As such I've been involved in architecting the entire back end, the iPhone app, dev-ops, recruiting and hiring, you name it!

A passionate web and mobile developer with a vision to create the most sophisticated user-friendly experiences, I began my career in the world of technology as a boy working alongside my father while he engineered large scale enterprise software applications. Committing from that point on to make it my lifeâ€™s work, I have spent the last 10+ years entrenched in multi-platform communication mediums.

Technology is a space that enables a global village of creative minds to work collectively with freedom and a goal to bring people closer together. There are few restrictions and a small team can single handedly change the way people share, discover and communicate. I am currently passionate about writing the best applications for the iPhone and Android platforms and hope to continue using the global village to create award-winning experiences that cross borders.

In the same spirit of Indiana Jones jumping head first into his adventures with little certainty, I approach my work in the same way, pushing through uncharted territories to ultimately create applications that reflect human instinct, making life more entertaining and evolved.
