    <main>
      <p>As CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://volu.me">Volu.me</a> for the past 10 years, I had the chance to
        gain a breadth of experience. The nature of a startup (especially in my field) is that you get the
        opportunity to become entrenched in all aspects of the business, technical, financial, and even HR side of
        things. As a result, you become a jack of all trades. As for my personal development, I&rsquo;ve been
        involved in architecting the entire back end; the iPhone app; dev-ops, recruiting and hiring; and
        that&rsquo;s only naming a few!</p>

      <p>From the blogs that I&rsquo;ll be posting on the site, you will come to notice that I have an
        enthusiastic eagerness to learn new tools that help me solve challenges in order to create sophisticated
        user-friendly experiences. In the same spirit of Indiana Jones jumping head first into his adventures with
        little certainty, I approach my work in the same way; combating unfamiliar territories and pushing
        personal boundaries.</p>

      <p>Enjoy!</p>
